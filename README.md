## About the Project

<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
### Project Description
This term we were tasked to create an Ecommerce web application by focusing on the technologies of the MERN stack.
This application will consist of complex front-end and back-end requirements.
My mock ecommerce webstore will sell travel mugs.

### Built With
MERN - Mongodb, Express.js, React, Node.js</br>
CSS - Cascading Style Sheet </br>
JWT Authentication - JSON Web Token </br>
GitHub - Internet hosting service for software development and version control using GIT </br>
Visual Studio - Integrated Development Enviroment </br>

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

For development, you require to create an account on [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Installation

Clone the project repository as follow:

1.  GitHub Desktop </br>
    Enter `https://github.com/DupieM/duplessismarine_221326_finalproject_dv_term3` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

To create the React app do the following steps:

1.  Go to Visual Studio code  </br>
    Open your Visual Studio code then click on File and then click on open folder
    Then navigate to where you created your folder and open it

2.  Start terminal </br>
    Go to 'Terminal' then click on new terminal.
    After that then Go back to 'Terminal' and then click on 'split terminal'.

3.  Start React Client </br>
    On one side of the terminal type 'cd ./client/' to navigate into that file.
    After that type 'npm start' to start the react app

4.  Start Server </br>
    On the other side of the terminal type 'cd ./server/' to navigate into that file.
    After that type 'npm run dev' to start the server

## Features and Functionality
### Log In/Sign Up Page
    I needed to allow for a user to sign up and then after the first use to log in to the website.
    JSON Web Tokens is used to authenticate users. Different user profiles will exist.

### Landing Page
    On this page all the new and discounted products will be displayed. 
    A slider is showcased with product information.

### Product Page
    On this page all available products need to be displayed.
    Different categories will be displayed whereby the user will be able to select certain products to be displayed. 

### Individual Item Page
    On this page all the information of a selected product from the products page will be displayed.
    Here the user will be ably to add the quantity he wants of the product and then add it to the cart.

### Inventory Page
    When the administrator logs in the inventory page can be selected where products can be updated, added and deleted.

### Order Page
    When the administrator logs in the order page can be selected, from this page an order can be deleted.

### Cart Page
    On this page the products added to the cart will be displayed with the total amount of the order.
    From here the user will be able to checkout.

### Checkout Page
    On this page the order details will be displayed and the user will be able to add the shipping address and payment details.
    When the user selects checkout an order will be created.

## Concept Process
I went with a simple and minimalistic UI design that fits an ecommerce website for travel mugs. 
I went with soft colours and a clean design as travelers want to buy something quickly and easily. 
I also used icons and a logo design resembling a minimalistic and clean design.

## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done for the website.

### Implementation Process
#### Highlights

The highlight was in using client server design for the ecommerce website.
Interfacing to the Mongo database and seeing data CRUD at work between the application and database was a highlight.

#### Challenges

Some challenges that I faced was the JWT Authentication. I kept on getting an authorisation error that I was not able to solve. 
Another challenge was to display data based on a selection like the categories on the product page.

### Future Implementation

Adding success and failure messages right through the application.
Enabling the JWT Authentication.
Adding a number to the cart icon in the header when there is something in the cart already.

## Final Outcome
