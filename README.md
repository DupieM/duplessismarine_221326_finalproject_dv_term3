## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

For development, you require to create an account on [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/).

### Installation

Clone the project repository as follow:

1.  GitHub Desktop </br>
    Enter `https://github.com/DupieM/duplessismarine_221326_finalproject_dv_term3` into the URL field and press the `Clone` button.

To create the React app do the following steps:

1.  Go to Visual Studio code  </br>
    Open your Visual Studio code then click on File and then click on open folder
    Then navigate to where you created your folder and open it

2.  Start terminal </br>
    Go to 'Terminal' then click on new terminal.
    After that then Go back to 'Terminal' and then click on 'split terminal'.

3.  Start React Client </br>
    On one side of the terminal type 'cd ./client/' to navigate into that file.
    After that type 'npm start' to start the react app

4.  Start Server </br>
    On the other side of the terminal type 'cd ./server/' to navigate into that file.
    After that type 'npm run dev' to start the server

## Features and Functionality
### Log In/Sign Up Page

I needed to allow for a user to sign up and then after the first use to log in to the website.
JSON Web Tokens is used to authenticate users. Different user profiles will exist.

## Development Process
### Theme of Web Application

I went with a simple and minimalistic UI design that fits an ecommerce website for travel mugs. 
I went with soft colours and a clean design as travelers want to buy something quickly and easily. 
I also used icons and a logo design resembling a minimalistic and clean design.

### Use Case Diagram

### Implementation Process
#### Highlights

The highlight was in using client server design for the ecommerce website.
Interfacing to the Mongo database and seeing data CRUD at work between the application and database was a highlight.

#### Challenges

Some challenges that I faced was the JWT Authentication. I kept on getting an authorisation error that I was not able to solve. 
Another challenge was to display data based on a selection like the categories on the product page.

### Future Implementation

Adding success and failure messages right through the application.
Enabling the JWT Authentication.
Adding a number to the cart icon in the header when there is something in the cart already.
To add more comments in my code to explain functionality.
